# Nothing much to say

###People lie, and there is almost nothing we can do about it. <br> 
<br>
Sometimes, you value the relationship you have with someone, when you suspect or even believe that they're lying, its indication made by your side will be deemed as rather intrusive, and this will damage your said relationship. <br> <br>

Because you value it, you take a step back from addressing the heart of the matter, even though the baseline is genuine, the indication abstraction which goes unsaid becomes a takeaway for accentuating it into a superficial relationship, but that surely doesnt mean that the entire time it was fake, right? ...right? 

<hr>
If I were given everything I wanted, I would never value it, and that is why I must keep striving.
